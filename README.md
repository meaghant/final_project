# What Effect Do Non-School Factors have on Preschoolers' Academic and Social Outcomes?

### Topic

Although early childhood education plays a tremendously important role in shaping a child's academic and social development, there are a number of factors outside the classroom that have a major influence on children's academic and behavioral development. I was most interested in these non-school factors. I examined three non-school factors: number of books in the home, maternal education level, and family income level, and compared their effects on two outcome variables: literacy and social development. 

### Data Source

I drew data from the Massachusetts Early Care and Education and School Readiness Study, available [here] (https://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR33968.v1). This study, conducted from 2001 to 2008 by a team of Wellesley reseachers, assesses the specific factors inside and outside of preschool classrooms that promote school readiness.

### Hypotheses and Variables

I hypothesized that preschool children who (1) are exposed to a greater number of books in their homes, (2) have mothers with a higher degree of education, and (3) come from higher-income households will have better literacy and social development outcomes. To gauge literacy outcomes, I chose the Phonological Awareness and Literacy Screening (PALS) score. To gauge behavioral outcomes, I chose the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) Score for social development. 

### Findings and Implications

There was a stronger correlation between all three non-school factors and literacy outcomes than with social development outcomes. This is perhaps surprising, given that the three factors I examined are all outside of the classroom and might thus be thought to play more of a role in a child's behavioral rather than academic development. The substantial drop-offs in performance seen at the lowest levels of privilege on each non-school factor suggests a need for non-school reform efforts directed towards those most in need. 

I thank you for taking the time to examine this project and hope you find it rewarding. Below please find the link to my app.
