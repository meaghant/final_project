# Final Project: What Effect Do Non-School Factors have on Preschoolers' Academic and Social Outcomes?

For this project, I examine data from the Massachusetts Early Care and Education and School Readiness Study, which assesses the specific factors inside and outside of infant and preschool classrooms that promote school readiness.

Although early childhood education plays a tremendously important role in shaping a child's academic and social development, I was most interested in factors outside the classroom. I chose to examine the non-school factors of number of books in the home, maternal education level, and family income level. I also chose to focus on preschool-age children rather than infants or toddlers.

I hypothesized that preschool children who (1) are exposed to a greater number of books in their homes, (2) have mothers with a higher degree of education, and (3) come from higher-income households will have better literacy and social development outcomes. To gauge literacy outcomes, I chose the Phonological Awareness and Literacy Screening (PALS) score. To gauge behavioral outcomes, I chose the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) Score for social development. 

I thank you for taking the time to examine this project and hope you find it rewarding. Below please find the link to my app:
