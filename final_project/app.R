# My data was relatively clean and did not require the grouping of multiple data frames, so instead of cleaning the data in a separate file and reading it in with an RDS, I chose to clean the data within this app.
# I selected the variables I planned to use: the three non-school factor variables, the two outcome variables, and the unique child ID grouping variable. I mutated these variables to make them easily understandable for the user.
# There were many other non-school factor variables in the data set, such as number of days read to per week, incidence of maternal depression, and number of toys in the household. I limited myself to three non-school factor variables because I did not want the app to present too many options to the user. I selected the three non-school factor variables that I found most interesting.
# I chose to filter out N/A values because I wanted to compare only data that was complete on all metrics. I acknowledge that this will leave out certain respondents who, for example, refused to share their income or education level.
